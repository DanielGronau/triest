Triest is Tetris reversed: You "cut out" Tetris pieces from a growing pile of blocks.

The game is controlled by mouse:

- the left mouse button "cuts out" a tetris piece from the top of the stack
- the right button turns your piece
- the middle button drops some random blocks, which helps you if you have no way to remove your actual piece
